# Python Script
This is a Python script which grabs the list of Bluetooth Assigned Numbers for GAP/GATT services, characteristics, descriptors and company IDs from [this github repo](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/bluetooth-numbers-database) and converts the data into a Pascal unit with records.

InsideBlue BLE Tool uses this unit to map UUIDs from BLE devices to service/characteristic/descriptor names and company names.
